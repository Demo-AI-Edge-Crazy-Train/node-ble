# Node BLE Testing device
This code allows you to flash an ESP32 device and create a BLE device that can be used for e2e testing.

Read [Testing](https://github.com/chrvadala/node-ble/blob/main/docs/documentation-testing.md) to see how to use it in a test.

## How to flash a test device

### 1. PlatformIO Setup
Install PlatformIO Core by following the instructions on the [official PlatformIO website](https://platformio.org/install/cli).
```bash
curl -fsSL -o get-platformio.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py
python3 get-platformio.py
```

### 2. Build firmware and flash device
```bash
cd ble-test-device/
platformio run -t upload
```

### 3. Read MAC Address and watch logs
```bash
platformio device monitor -b 115200
```
When everything works fine, you can see a log like that, generated by your test device.
```
Boot
Device UUID: 00:00:00:00:00:00
Ready
Client connected
Notifications and indications are disabled
Characteristic1 value written: hello_world_%{ISO_TS}
Characteristic1 value read: ECHO>hello_world_%{ISO_TS}
Notifications or indications are enabled
Client disconnected
```
